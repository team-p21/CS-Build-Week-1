# Room

# World/Grid
This is the space in which the rooms will take up to make the track
It has a height and a width 

Whats the best way to draw the map
What kind of map should we generate
Should it be random each time? Partially random?
How is the endpoint going to return the data? /api/rooms/ 
We need a grid


Rooms = [
    {
    roomname
    description
    color
    pointsto
    },
    {

    },
]
